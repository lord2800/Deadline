A speedy, fast, simple web framework for PHP 5.3+

Getting Started
========

Currently, there's no installer script. That means leave your site off
of live mode until you've loaded every page at least once. Additionally,
there's no support (yet!) for phar mode, though that's one of my goals.
To get started, get the source code, unzip it to a web folder, make a
settings.json file (it can be empty), and run `composer install` in the
src directory. Eventually I'll make everything run from composer so all
you do is run `composer install` and everything works.
