Deadline
========

A fast, simple web framework for PHP 5.4+

The focus of Deadline is to utilize new features and better design paradigms in PHP 5.4+ to create a fast, simple, scalable framework. This means:

* Use any and all appropriate metaphors for things like views, models, and controllers
* As much unit test coverage as possible
* Simple deployment--this one is subjective, but if it takes more than copying a few files (a composer.json? maybe just a phar?), then it's too complicated
* Easy setup--you should be up and running in minutes, with the default configuration being sane enough to support a freestanding website

It's obviously not there yet, but it's a work in progress.
